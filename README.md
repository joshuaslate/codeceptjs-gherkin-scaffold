# codeceptjs-gherkin-scaffold README

Generates the boilerplate for a CodeceptJS steps file based on a Gherkin feature file.

## Features

Open the command palette and select Generate Steps from All Features to generate steps for all of your features files.

If you simply want to generate steps for one feature file, open it, then right click and click on Generate Steps from Feature.

After generation, your `codecept.json` file should have been edited to include the new steps, and your steps files should have been created in the designated directory.
